Hannah Alverson's Professional Portfolio

## Description

This professional portfolio was built to showcase all of the applications that I have created throughout my career. As of now, I am still a student at the DU Coding Boot Camp, so I don't have many deployed applications. However, I am consistently working on new projects that will be added as they are completed.

This portfolio was built using only HTML and CSS, but will be updated with more languages and funtions as my coding skills improve.

- Navigation bar to nagivate to specifc areas of the webpage.
