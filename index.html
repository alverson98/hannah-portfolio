          <p>
            My name is Hannah and I am currently a student in the University of
            Denver Coding Boot Camp. Currently, I have a B.S. degree in
            Nutritional Sciences with a minor in Sustainable Agriculture and
            Food Systems from Michigan State University. My decision to pursue a
            software development career path came from a life-long interest in
            computers. My dream is to combine my B.S. degree knowledge with my new software development skills to create an application to help people be healthier. <div class="fun-fact">Fun fact: My 5th grade science fair project was a website
